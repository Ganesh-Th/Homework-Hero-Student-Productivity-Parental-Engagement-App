## 📊 Market Size Analysis

### Market Segments
We analyzed school-age students, parents, and schools as potential market participants, with both global and India-focused calculations.

### Market Size Calculations

#### TAM — Total Addressable Market
Everyone who could theoretically use this type of product worldwide.

- **Student Population:** ~1.5 billion students globally in K–12 (UNESCO data)
- **Pricing Model:** $2 per user/month subscription or in-app monetization
- **Calculation:** 1.5B students × $2 × 12 months = **$36 billion annually**
- **TAM ≈ $36B globally**

#### SAM — Serviceable Available Market
Target market: Urban, tech-connected families in India initially.

- **Total Students:** ~100 million students in India's urban and semi-urban K–12 education system
- **Smartphone Penetration:** ~70% (approximately 70M potential users)
- **Realistic Reach:** 30% adoption potential → 21M users
- **Calculation:** 21M × $2 × 12 months = **$504 million annually**
- **SAM ≈ $500M (India-focused)**

#### SOM — Serviceable Obtainable Market
Realistic short-term market capture goal.

- **Target Capture:** 1% of SAM in India
- **Calculation:** 1% × $500M = **$5 million annual potential revenue**
- **SOM ≈ $5M (short-term realistic goal)**

### Takeaway:
The TAM-SAM-SOM framework demonstrates strong scalability potential. The app starts in a niche market (India's student productivity segment) but operates within a multi-billion dollar global opportunity, with clear pathways for expansion.
