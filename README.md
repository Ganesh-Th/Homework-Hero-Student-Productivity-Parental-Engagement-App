# Homework-Hero-Student-Productivity-Parental-Engagement-App

## Overview
Homework Hero is a no-code education app designed to help students stay productive by tracking homework, submitting assignments, and earning playtime rewards with parental approval.
Built using Glide, the app connects students, parents, and teachers to create accountability, motivation, and communication around daily learning tasks.
This project was developed end-to-end as part of a Product Management learning journey, applying real-world PM frameworks and techniques — from user research to MVP launch.

## Problem Statement
Students often struggle to complete homework consistently due to lack of structure, motivation, and real-time feedback. Parents have limited visibility into their child’s progress, and teachers find it difficult to track submissions across multiple students. This results in missed deadlines, lower engagement, and poor accountability. <br>
Homework Hero bridges this gap by providing:<br>
• Enabling teachers to assign and monitor homework.<br>
• A centralized dashboard for students to view and submit homework.<br>
• Notifications for parents once all homework is done.<br>
• A reward-based motivation system that reinforces positive study habits.<br>

## Product Vision
To make learning more engaging and accountable by integrating students, parents, and teachers into one seamless digital workflow.

## Competitor Analysis

Main Competitors:<br>
• Google Classroom – used by teachers and schools to assign and manage homework.<br>
• Forest / Focus To-Do – helps users (including students) stay focused by gamifying tasks.<br>
• Google Family Link / Apple Screen Time – allows parents to control when and how kids use devices or apps.<br>

## Market Size:
Market Segments<br>
We’ll look at school-age students, parents, and schools as potential market participants.
For calculation purposes, let’s use global and India-focused examples, since your project could be localized or scaled later.
 
Market Size Calculations<br>
* TAM — Total Addressable Market<br>
 * Everyone who could theoretically use this type of product worldwide.<br>
	* • There are about 1.5 billion students globally in K–12 (UNESCO data).<br>
	* • Assume an average $2 per user/month subscription model or in-app monetization.<br>
	* • TAM = 1.5B students × $2 × 12 months = $36 billion annually.<br>
          * TAM ≈ $36B globally<br>

* SAM — Serviceable Available Market<br>
* Let’s assume you target urban, tech-connected families in India first:<br>
	* • Around 100 million students in India’s urban and semi-urban K–12 education system.<br>
	* • Smartphone penetration: roughly 70% (so ~70M potential users).<br>
	* • Assume 30% of them are realistically reachable for digital education tools → 21M users.<br>
	* • 21M × $2 × 12 months = $504 million annually.<br>
          * SAM ≈ $500M (India-focused)<br>

* SOM — Serviceable Obtainable Market<br>
* If we can capture just 1% of the SAM in India:<br>
	* • 1% × $500M = $5 million annual potential revenue.<br>
           * SOM ≈ $5M (short-term realistic goal)<br>

Takeaway:<br>
   * The TAM-SAM-SOM framework shows strong scalability potential — your app starts in a niche (India’s student productivity market) but sits in a multi-billion global opportunity.
